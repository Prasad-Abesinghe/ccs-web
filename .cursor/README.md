# Cursor Project Rules

This directory contains project rules for the Cursor AI-assisted editor to help maintain the project structure and follow best practices while developing.

## How to Use These Rules

1. The rules are automatically loaded by Cursor when you open the project.
2. Cursor AI will use these rules to guide you when making changes to the codebase.
3. When you ask Cursor AI to create or modify files, it will follow these rules automatically.

## Rules Overview

The main project rules file is located at `.cursor/rules/css-web-project-rules.mdc` and contains guidelines for:

- Component structure and organization
- Routing with Next.js App Router
- API hooks using React Query
- Type definitions
- Authentication
- Styling guidelines
- Code style and conventions

## Updating Rules

If you need to update or add new rules:

1. Edit the `.cursor/rules/css-web-project-rules.mdc` file
2. Add the new guidelines using Markdown format
3. Cursor will automatically use the updated rules in future interactions

## Benefits

- Maintains consistent project structure

- Helps team members understand project organization
